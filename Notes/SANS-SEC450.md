Blue Teams and Operations


<ul>
<li> People: Mindset, mental models, career progression, burnout</li>
<li>Process: Analysis, investigation theory, triage, and data flow</li>
<li> Technology: Network and host monitoring, understanding protocols,spotting attacks, scripting and automation</li>
</ul>





The problem is, SOC work can be toughâ€¦

<ul>
<li> High barrier to entry</li>
<li> Ticket/alert based, repetitive work</li>
<li> Tiered structure may limit visibility and scope</li>
<li> Over-prescribed workflow restricts freedom</li>
<li> Repetitive clicking and information filling</li>
<li> High turnover means "revolving door" of coworkers</li>
</ul>



A modern defense is our only hope, this means:
<ul>
<li> Presumption of Compromise</li>
<li> Detection Oriented Defense</li>
<li> Proactive Detection: Hunt Teams</li>
<li> Post-Exploitation Focus</li>
<li> Response-Driven</li>
<li> Risk Informed Strategy</li>
</ul>




The Components of Security Operations
<ul>
<li>People: Performing analysis and investigation, design and run processes</li>
<li>Process: The defined sequence of events performed to achieve an end goal</li>
<li>Technology: Hardware and software used to accomplish the mission</li>
</ul>


Four core questions 
1. What are we trying to protect?
2. What are the threats?
3. How do you detect them?
4. How will you respond?
